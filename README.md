Demo using Three.JS library and Boolean calculation to cut a bone
This is a demo using Three.JS library and Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) calculation implemented as ThreeBSP function by chandlerprall. The applicatiton runs on standard browser and loads a model of the human bone into the scene. User can then add a cutting saw (modeled by a thin plate geometry) and then adjust its position and orientation, finally issue a cut command to cut the model bone. After cutting finishes, user can save the scene as gltf file or export the model as stl file to the download folder.
